    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
        <p> The main idea of this project was to explore the pandas library in python. There was multiple steps to this project. We first started with basic data wrangling. In this part of the project we learned how to read in a CSV and convert it to a dataframe that can be used to make graphs. The middle stage of this project included creating static graphs and learning how to specify values within the dataframe. In this stage of the project the main focus was learning how code and manipulate the graphs to make them visually pleasing. The last part of the project included using FIP codes to make a chloropleth map and add animation. The animation shows the change in new cases(hotspots) over a given period of time.</p>
